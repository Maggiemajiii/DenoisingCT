# DenoisingCT
Deep Learning Methods for denoising CT images

The dataset consisted of CT images, noise and standard deviation maps for 10 subjects. 

1. The code in this branch performs intial data inspection to understand the nature of the dataset.
2. Once the dataset was analyzed, augmentations were carried out.
3. Augmentations were rotation, flipping.
4. Input signal was generated by ct_generated = ct_signal + (k * ct_noise), where k = [0,5].
5. The ct_generated and std_maps were loaded onto a CustomDataset classes, and the necessary transforms were performed.
6. The data loader was configured to take in a 80-10-10 train-test-validation split, with batch_size = 10.
7. The UNet model was trained on 10 epochs, optimized by Adam with a learning rate of 0.001.
8. The chosen loss function was MSE.
